      Please create a list of no more than 3 sub-questions whose answers would help to inform the answer to the initial question.
      The purpose for these sub-questions could be:
        1) decomposition to isolate individual entities (i.e., 'compare sales of company A and company B' -> ['what are sales for company A', 'what are sales for company B'])
        
        2) clarification and/or disambiguation of ambiguous terms (i.e., 'what is our success with company A' -> ['what are our sales with company A','what is our market share with company A', 'is company A a reference customer for us', etc.])
        
        3) if a term or a metric is essentially clear, but it could relate to various aspects of an entity and you are generally familiar with the entity, then you can create sub-questions that are more specific (i.e.,  'what do we do to improve product X' -> 'what do we do to improve scalability of product X', 'what do we do to improve performance of product X', 'what do we do to improve stability of product X', ...)
        
        4) research individual questions and areas that should really help to ultimately answer the question.

      Important:
      - Each sub-question should lend itself to be answered by a RAG system. Correspondingly, phrase the question in a way that is amenable to that. An example set of sub-questions based on an initial question could look like this:
      'what can I do to improve the performance of workflow X' -> 'what are the settings affecting performance for workflow X', 'are there complaints and bugs related to workflow X performance', 'what are performance benchmarks for workflow X', ...
      
      - Consequently, again, don't just decompose, but make sure that the sub-questions have the proper form. I.e., no  'I', etc.
      
      - Do not(!) create sub-questions that are clarifying question to the person who asked the question, like making suggestions or asking the user for more information! This is not useful for the actual question-answering process! You need to take the information from the user as it is given to you! For example, should the question be of the type 'why does product X perform poorly for customer A', DO NOT create a sub-question of the type 'what are the settings that customer A uses for product X?'! A valid sub-question could rather be 'which settings for product X have been shown to lead to poor performance for customers?'

      {persona_specification}
      Use the information provided below - and only the provided information - to answer the provided main question.

      The information provided below consists of:
        1) a number of answered sub-questions - these are very important to help you organize your thoughts and your answer
        
        2) a number of documents that are deemed relevant for the question.

      {history}

      It is critical that you provide proper inline citations to documents in the format [D1], [D2], [D3], etc.! It is important that the citation is close to the information it supports. If you have multiple citations that support a fact, please cite for example as [D1][D3], or [D2][D4], etc. Feel free to also cite sub-questions in addition to documents, but make sure that you have documents cited with the sub-question citation. If you want to cite both a document and a sub-question, please use [D1][Q3], or [D2][D7][Q4], etc. Again, please NEVER cite sub-questions without a document citation! Proper citations are very important for the user!

      IMPORTANT RULES:
      - If you cannot reliably answer the question solely using the provided information, say that you cannot reliably answer. You may give some additional facts you learned, but do not try to invent an answer.
      
      - If the information is empty or irrelevant, just say "I do not have enough information to answer this question.".
      
      - If the information is relevant but not fully conclusive, provide an answer to the extent you can but also specify that the information is not conclusive and why.
      
      - When constructing/considering categories, focus less on the question and more on the context actually provided! Example: if the question is about the products of company A, and the content provided lists a number of products, do automatically NOT ASSUME that those belong to company A!  So you cannot list those as products of company A, despite the fact that the question is about company A's products. What you should say instead is maybe something like "Here are a number of products, but I cannot say whether some or all of them belong to company A: <proceed with listing the products>". It is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL that the answer constructed reflects actual knowledge. For that matter, also consider the title of the document and other information that may be provided. If that does not make it clear that - in the example above - the products belong to company A, then do not list them as products of company A, just maybe as "A list products that may not necessarily belong to company A". THIS IS IMPORTANT!
      
      - Related, if the context provides a list of items with associated data or other information that seems to align with the categories in the question, but does not specify whether the items or the information is specific to the exact requested category, then present the information with a disclaimer. Use a title such as "I am not sure whether these items (or the information provided) is specific to [relevant category] or whether these are all [specific group], but I found this information may be helpful:" followed by the list of items and associated data/or information discovered.
      
      - Do not group together items amongst one headline where not all items belong to the category of the headline! (Example: "Products used by Company A" where some products listed are not built by Company A, but other companies,
      or it is not clear that the products are built by Company A). Only state what you know for sure!
      
      - Do NOT perform any calculations in the answer! Just report on facts.
      
      - If appropriate, organizing your answer in bullet points is often useful.

      Again, you should be sure that the answer is supported by the information provided!
      Try to keep your answer concise. But also highlight uncertainties you may have should there be substantial ones, or assumptions you made.
